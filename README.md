## üõ†Ô∏è Project Insights

This project was initially created as a playground to experiment with various frontend technologies. It included features like:
- **Blinking Stars Container:** Dynamic visual effect for enhancing the UI.
- **Gradients:** Stylish CSS gradients for a vibrant look.
- **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Integration:** Core technologies for frontend development.
- **Webpack:** Utilized for efficient asset management and compilation.

However, the original implementation was very unmaintainable. As a result, I refactored everything into a new version of the application, now available as a SaaS at [CustomColorBook.com](https://customcolorbook.com).

- [Hyperflex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TYkDy54q4E) for dynamic and visually striking effects.
- [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@OnlineTutorialsYT), which motivated me to continue developing my frontend skills.
